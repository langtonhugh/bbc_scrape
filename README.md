# BBC scrape

## Overview

Project scraping BBC.com's 'most read' table (every 5 minutes) and visualizing what's popular (and for how long).

## Important files

- The raw scrapes are in the **scrapes** folder, saved as .zip files by date span.
- Using the **web_post_single_topic.R** script, you can make some example plots about specific topics based on keywords.
- The scrape script used was **most_read_scrape_error_catch.R** but note that the BBC recently revamped their entire website! It will likely need minor tweaks to the html element selection.
